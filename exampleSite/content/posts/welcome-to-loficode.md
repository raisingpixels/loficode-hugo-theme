Welcome to the LofiCode Hugo theme! This theme is designed for developers and creatives who want to create a warm, inviting blog with a retro lo-fi aesthetic.

## What Makes LofiCode Special?

LofiCode isn't just another Hugo theme - it's a complete experience designed to make both writing and reading a joy.

### üéµ Ambient Sounds

One of the unique features of LofiCode is the built-in ambient sound system. You can choose from:

- **Coffee Shop**: Perfect background noise for coding sessions
- **Rain**: Gentle rainfall to help you focus
- **Fireplace**: Cozy crackling sounds for those winter coding nights

### ‚òï Coffee-Themed Reading Time

Instead of boring "X minute read" indicators, LofiCode shows reading time with coffee cups! Each cup represents roughly 3 minutes of reading time.

{{< coffee-break title="Take a Break" >}}
Speaking of coffee, why not grab a cup right now? This theme is best enjoyed with your favorite brew! ‚òï
{{< /coffee-break >}}

### üåô Automatic Dark Mode

The theme automatically detects your system preference for dark or light mode, but you can always toggle manually using the button in the header.

### üîç Live Search

The search functionality works in real-time, helping your readers find exactly what they're looking for without leaving the page.

## Code Examples

LofiCode makes your code look beautiful with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code
function createCozyAtmosphere() {
  const coffee = brewCoffee();
  const music = playLoFiBeats();
  const code = writeAwesomeCode();

  return { coffee, music, code };
}
```

```css
/* Beautiful CSS styling */
.cozy-theme {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FFE5B4 0%, #FFCCCB 25%);
  color: var(--text-primary);
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
```

## Getting Started

Setting up LofiCode is simple:

1. Add the theme to your Hugo site
2. Configure your `hugo.toml` file

The theme is fully responsive and works beautifully on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
